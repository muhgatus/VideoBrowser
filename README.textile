h1. VideoBrowser

This web frontend displays recodings in a configurated folder and its
subfolders. You can watch them via drag&drop to vlc. You can also
manage your videofiles by deleting them. You can sort them by name,
modification time or size. You can also select more than one file 
and generate a playlist on the fly.

h2. Installation

You have to edit VideoBrowser.py in order to set the correct PATH to the
video files and the KEY. The KEY is used to sign delete requests. This
increases the security a little bit, if you like to run this front end
without any kind of authentication.

You may also edit the HTML variable and set the correct urls for the
Javascript and CSS files.

<pre>PATH='/recordings/hts'
KEY='xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'

HTML="""<html>
 <head>
  <title>Videobrowser</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/VideoBrowser.css">
  <script src="/jquery-2.0.3.min.js"></script>
  <script src="/jquery.base64.min.js"></script>
  <script src="/VideoBrowser.js"></script>
 </head>
 <body>
{0}
 </body>
</html>
"""
</pre>

I like to recommend that you use gunicorn and nginx to run this web frontend,
but feel free to use another way. Perhabs you might wanna share your
approach with me and I will try to add your configuration stubs to this
repository.
